# The Brick Lamp Firmware

Written in rust for the ATTiny85 microcontroller.

## Building a firmware programmer with Arduino UNO

I used the Arduino UNO with the [Arduino as ISP](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/communication/spi/) firmware as the programmer. Wired it on a breadboard as described. **Importantly, I had to put a 10uF capacitor between the `RESET` and `GND` pins (negative leg to `GND`) _on the UNO_.** Otherwise `avrdude` would report cryptic "protocol errors".

## Flashing the Firmware

1. Install dependencies: `brew install avr-gcc avf-libc avrdude rave-dude`
2. This firmware assumes the ATTiny is configured with 8MHz clock. By default it uses 1MHz. Configure it to use the 8MHz internal clock: `avrdude -v -p attiny85 -c arduino_as_isp -P /dev/cu.usbmodem101 -b 19200 -e -U efuse:w:0xff:m -U hfuse:w:0xdf:m -U lfuse:w:0xe2:m`. Needs to be done just once per chip.
3. Build and flash the firmware: `cargo run`. Internally, it uses `ravedude` which in turn uses `avrdude` to flash the built executable.
